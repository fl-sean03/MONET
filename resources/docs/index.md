# MONET Documentation

## Overview

MONET (MOlecular NEtwork Toolkit) is a comprehensive toolkit for processing molecular data files (MDF, CAR, PDB) that supports tasks such as grid replication, force-field updates, and charge corrections.

## Documentation Structure

- [API Reference](api/index.md) - Detailed API documentation
- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md) - Step-by-step tutorials
- [Architecture](architecture/index.md) - System architecture and design
- [Examples](examples/index.md) - Example usage

## Key Features

- Parse and manipulate MDF, CAR, and PDB molecular formats
- Create grid replications of molecular systems
- Update force-field types based on mapping files
- Modify atomic charges for molecular simulations
- Convert to NAMD format via external tools integration
- Modern object-based pipeline architecture with chaining support
- Legacy file-based API support (deprecated)

## Getting Started

See the [README.md](../../README.md) file for installation instructions and basic usage examples. You'll also find complete code examples in the [examples](../examples/) directory.
