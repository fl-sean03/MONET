# MONET Examples

This section provides various examples of how to use the MONET (MOlecular NEtwork Toolkit) package for common tasks and workflows.

## Basic Examples

- [Grid Replication](./grid_replication.md) - Create grid replications of molecular systems
- [Force Field Updates](./force_field_updates.md) - Update force field types in molecular files
- [Charge Updates](./charge_updates.md) - Update atomic charges in molecular files

## Advanced Examples

- [Pipeline Usage](./pipeline_usage.md) - Using the pipeline API for chained operations
- [NAMD Conversion](./namd_conversion.md) - Converting molecular files to NAMD format
- [Custom Transformations](./custom_transformations.md) - Creating custom molecular transformations

## Complete Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the [examples](../../examples/) directory in the repository:

- **Basic Examples**: Simple, focused examples of individual operations
- **Advanced Examples**: More complex examples showing multiple operations and advanced features
- **Legacy Examples**: Examples showing the deprecated file-based API (for migration purposes)
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorial scripts

Each example includes detailed comments to explain the code and can be used as a starting point for your own projects.
